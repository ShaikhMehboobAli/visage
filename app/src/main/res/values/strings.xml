It is a commonly used indicator of overall body fat and serves as a tool for categorizing individuals as being underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese on the basis of health risk.

Body Mass Index is a fair predictor of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, and certain cancers. It is the one of the best anthropometric predictors of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride levels; these are important factors for cardio-metabolic diseases. It is also one of the best anthropometric predictors of uric acid levels (high uric acid levels contribute to gallstones). A limitation of Body Mass Index is that it cannot distinguish between fat and muscle mass and thus can be inaccurate in muscular individuals.

You can calculate your Body Mass Index using the formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m&amp;sup2;)

According to the **World Health Organization**:

| BMI | Weight Status |
| --- | --- |
| Below 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5-24.9 | Normal weight |
| 25.0-29.9 | Pre-obesity |
| 30.0-34.9 | Obesity Class I |
| 35.0-39.9 | Obesity Class II |
| 40 or above | Obesity Class III |

A slower breathing rate may be caused by certain medications or suggest an underlying medical condition, for example, hypothyroidism, heart condition, electrolyte imbalance, etc. A faster breathing rate could have many causes including walking fast or exercise, asthma, anxiety, infection, or cardiovascular condition.

    <string name="INFO_BSI">"Body Shape Index is a measure of abdominal region size (as determined by waist circumference) relative to overall body size (as determined by Body Mass Index and height). A low Body Shape Index corresponds to a ‘chilli pepper'-shaped body. As BSI increases, body shape resembles a pear, then a pineapple, and then an apple. A larger abdominal region suggests elevated levels of deep abdominal fat, which is associated with various health risks.

Body Shape Index is a particularly good predictor of mortality (from all causes), as well as a fair predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It is associated with elevated triglyceride levels, which may partially contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases.

This risk score considers your gender, age, Body Mass Index, systolic blood pressure and antihypertensive medication status, as well as your smoking status and diabetes status when available.

    <string name="INFO_HR_1">"An unusually high or low resting heart rate may be an indicator of an underlying problem. Consult a medical professional if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats per minute (bpm) - especially if you have other signs or symptoms such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.

Resting heart rate can be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

- Fitness level
- Age
- Cardiovascular disease
- Smoking
- Medications
- Body position (e.g. standing, sitting or lying down)

If you are concerned about your resting heart rate or have further questions, please consult with a medical professional.

    <string name="INFO_HR_2">"A range of 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) is considered a normal range for an adult's resting heart rate.

Resting heart rate can be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:

- Fitness level
- Age
- Cardiovascular disease
- Smoking
- Medications
- Body position (e.g. standing, sitting or lying down)

In general, a lower resting heart rate is indicative of more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. Athletes can have a normal resting heart rate below 60 bpm with some having resting heart rates closer to 40 bpm.

    <string name="INFO_HRV">"Heart Rate Variability refers to the variability in the timing between one heartbeat and the next. Anura measures this with SDNN, which is the standard deviation of the interval between normal heartbeats (in milliseconds). A higher SDNN corresponds to more inter-beat variability.

Increased heart rate variability suggests an increase in parasympathetic activity and/or a decrease in sympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system. 

High resting heart rate variability is considered healthy and means that the heart is more flexible to the changing needs of the body.
"</string>
    <string name="INFO_IHB">"The number displayed is the number of irregular heartbeats Anura detected in 30 seconds. 

An irregular heartbeat is one that occurs outside of your heart's normal rhythm. The beat may have occurred sooner than expected or your heart may have seemed to 'skip' a beat. Sometimes it can feel like a thump in your chest, or the feeling that your heart is beating quickly or fluttering.

Irregular heartbeats are usually harmless. Most often they are triggered by things that increase adrenaline in the body like anxiety, caffeine, and nicotine.

In rare cases, they could indicate a more serious condition like an electrolyte imbalance or a heart condition. You should consult your doctor if you have a persistent irregular heartbeat. You should seek immediate medical attention if the onset of irregular heartbeats is combined with other symptoms of a heart problem like dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath."</string>
    <string name="INFO_SKINAGE">"Skin Age is an estimate of your age based on the condition of the surface of your face.

This estimation can be used as an indicator for your facial skin aging.

This estimation may be influenced by many factors such as fatigue level, the use of skincare or cosmetics products.

Video images taken in poor lighting conditions (e.g., backlighting, overhead lighting) may distort the estimation of your facial skin age."</string>
    <string name="INFO_STARS">"### What do the stars mean?

Anura uses a 5-star rating system to let you know the quality of your measurement based on the lighting conditions that illuminate your face.

#### ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ 4 - 5 stars

Good lighting conditions. You have well lit conditions and the light is spread evenly (i.e. no shadows) across your face.

#### ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ 2 - 3 stars

Adequate light conditions. The light on your face is sufficient enough (i.e. not too low) and spread evenly enough across your face. 

#### ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ 1 star

Poor lighting conditions. The light on your face is too low and uneven or there was too much movement after the measurement started."</string>

When measured at rest, this index can be used as an indicator of cardiovascular health as it is strongly correlated with vascular stiffness.

A person with a high Tau has better vascular health than a person with a low Tau. Also, certain transient activities and physiological events can lead to immediate changes in Tau (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking)."</string>
    <string name="INFO_WATHR">"Waist-to-height ratio is an individual's waist circumference expressed as a percentage of their height (with both measured in the same units). Individuals with elevated waist-to-height ratio have a larger abdominal region in proportion to their height, suggesting elevated levels of deep abdominal fat. Such fat is associated with various health risks.

Waist-to-height ratio is a particularly good predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. It is associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors like elevated total cholesterol and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

On average, Anura will estimate your waist-to-height ratio to within 4 percentage points of its actual value.

A lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia), could be a sign that you have been in the cold too long or potentially a sign of a significant infection (sepsis), shock, or other medical condition (especially when accompanied by other symptoms like chills, confusion or breathing problems)."</string>
